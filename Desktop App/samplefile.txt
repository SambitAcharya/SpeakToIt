Computer science is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications.
It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition,
representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information, whether such information is encoded as bits in a computer memory or transcribed
in genes and protein structures in a biological cell.
